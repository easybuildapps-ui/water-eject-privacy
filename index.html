<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: January 17, 2025</small></p>

<p>Water Eject ("we", "us", "our") provides a mobile application available on a freemium basis. This Privacy Policy explains what information may be collected when you use the app, how it is used, and what rights you have as a user.</p>
<p>By using the app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We do not ask you to create an account in the app and we do not request your name, email address or phone number inside the app.</p>

<p>While you use the app, the following categories of data may be collected automatically:</p>

<h3>1.1. Usage Data</h3>
<p>Usage Data includes information about how you interact with the app, such as opened screens, taps, session duration, device type, operating system version, country/region, IP address, device identifiers and other technical details generated by your device.</p>

<h3>1.2. Purchase and Subscription Data</h3>
<p>If you make in-app purchases or activate a subscription, the app may process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>information about the purchase or subscription status;</li>
  <li>purchase receipts needed to verify access to paid features;</li>
  <li>technical data necessary to validate transactions, prevent fraud and restore access to purchases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>We may use the collected information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide and maintain core functionality of the app;</li>
  <li>enable and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions;</li>
  <li>analyze how the app is used and improve stability, performance and user experience;</li>
  <li>detect, prevent and resolve technical issues or potential abuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not use the collected information to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies and we do not sell your data to third parties for advertising purposes.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>To support purchases, subscriptions, analytics and campaign measurement, the app may integrate third-party services (for example, services that process in-app transactions or measure the effectiveness of user acquisition campaigns).</p>

<p>These providers may process technical data such as device information, usage events and purchase-related data strictly for the purpose of operating their services on our behalf (for example, verifying receipts, managing subscription status, preventing fraud and providing aggregated statistics).</p>

<p>All third-party providers are required to handle data in accordance with applicable privacy and security requirements.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain information only for as long as necessary to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide access to app features and purchases;</li>
  <li>fulfil legal obligations (for example, accounting or tax requirements where applicable);</li>
  <li>maintain security, prevent abuse and resolve technical issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Usage Data is generally retained for a limited period and used only for internal purposes described in this Policy.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>request access to information related to your use of the app;</li>
  <li>request correction or deletion of such information where applicable;</li>
  <li>object to or restrict certain types of processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to exercise your rights or request deletion of data associated with your use of the app, you can contact us by email. We may ask you to provide certain technical details (for example, device information or purchase receipts) in order to locate the relevant records.</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>

<p>We may share information with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>service providers that help us operate the app and process purchases and subscriptions;</li>
  <li>public authorities, if we are legally required to do so or if such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or comply with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information may be processed on servers located outside of your country or region. By using the app, you agree that your data may be processed in other jurisdictions, subject to appropriate safeguards.</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>

<p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information processed in connection with the app. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The app is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with information, please contact us so that we can remove it.</p>

<h2>9. Links to Other Services</h2>

<p>The app may contain links to websites or services that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third parties. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of every website or service you visit.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
